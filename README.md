# startup-scripts
Hi! These are the AutoHotKey scripts that are available upon my PC's startup. These are just little shortcuts that work for me!

The majority of my text expansion (replacing text after typing a snippet) is done in [Espanso](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https://espanso.org/) instead, as I find it more reliable for text expansion than AutoHotKey.
